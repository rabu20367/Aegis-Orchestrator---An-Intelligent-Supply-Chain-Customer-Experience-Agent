# Aegis Orchestrator Demo Scenarios

## Overview

This document outlines the three key demo scenarios that showcase Aegis Orchestrator's capabilities. Each scenario demonstrates different aspects of the AI-powered system and its impact on the Online Boutique experience.

## Scenario 1: Intelligent Upsell & Personalized Checkout

### Objective
Demonstrate AI-powered personalization and dynamic pricing capabilities that increase average order value (AOV) and improve customer experience.

### Setup
1. User browses the Online Boutique website
2. User adds a "yellow sweater" to their cart
3. User proceeds to checkout

### AI Response
1. **Personalization Agent** analyzes user's browsing history and preferences
2. **AI identifies** user's preference for casual wear and color coordination
3. **System suggests** matching "denim jeans" with a 10% bundle discount
4. **Dynamic pricing** applies personalized discount based on user profile
5. **Checkout experience** is enhanced with relevant recommendations

### Technical Flow
```
User Action → Cart Update Event → Orchestrator Agent → Personalization Agent
    ↓
MCP Server → Online Boutique API → Product Data → AI Analysis
    ↓
Recommendation Generation → Dynamic Pricing → Checkout Enhancement
```

### Expected Outcomes
- **Increased AOV**: Bundle suggestions lead to higher order values
- **Improved UX**: Personalized recommendations feel relevant and helpful
- **Higher Conversion**: Dynamic pricing encourages purchase completion
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Tailored experience builds loyalty

### Demo Script
1. "Let me show you how our AI personalizes the shopping experience..."
2. "When a customer adds a yellow sweater to their cart..."
3. "Our AI analyzes their preferences and suggests matching jeans..."
4. "Notice the 10% bundle discount and personalized pricing..."
5. "This increases average order value while improving customer satisfaction..."

## Scenario 2: Predictive Inventory & Dynamic Rerouting

### Objective
Showcase proactive inventory management and intelligent fulfillment optimization that prevents stockouts and maintains service levels.

### Setup
1. System monitors inventory levels across multiple warehouses
2. AI detects potential stock shortage in East Coast warehouse
3. Popular shirt is predicted to sell out within 24 hours

### AI Response
1. **Inventory Agent** predicts stock shortage using demand forecasting
2. **System automatically** reroutes new orders to West Coast warehouse
3. **Customer Comms Agent** proactively emails affected customers
4. **Compensation strategy** offers $5 credit for slight delivery delay
5. **Transparent communication** builds trust and maintains satisfaction

### Technical Flow
```
Inventory Monitoring → Demand Prediction → Stock Alert → Orchestrator Agent
    ↓
Inventory Agent → Warehouse Optimization → Order Rerouting
    ↓
Customer Comms Agent → Proactive Notification → Compensation Strategy
```

### Expected Outcomes
- **Prevented Stockouts**: Proactive management avoids inventory issues
- **Maintained SLAs**: Orders still ship on time from alternative locations
- **Customer Trust**: Transparent communication about changes
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient warehouse utilization

### Demo Script
1. "Our AI continuously monitors inventory across all warehouses..."
2. "When it predicts a popular item will sell out in the East Coast..."
3. "The system automatically reroutes orders to the West Coast warehouse..."
4. "Customers are proactively notified with a $5 credit for the slight delay..."
5. "This prevents stockouts while maintaining customer satisfaction..."

## Scenario 3: Proactive Problem Solver

### Objective
Demonstrate intelligent anomaly detection and automated problem resolution that maintains system reliability and customer experience.

### Setup
1. Payment processing microservice experiences a failure
2. Multiple orders are stuck in "pending" status
3. Customers are experiencing checkout errors

### AI Response
1. **Anomaly Resolver Agent** detects payment processing failure
2. **System automatically** places affected orders in "pending" state
3. **Customer Comms Agent** sends reassuring messages to customers
4. **Resolution strategy** includes retry mechanisms and fallback options
5. **Proactive communication** prevents cart abandonment and confusion

### Technical Flow
```
System Monitoring → Anomaly Detection → Orchestrator Agent → Anomaly Resolver
    ↓
Problem Analysis → Resolution Strategy → Order State Management
    ↓
Customer Comms Agent → Proactive Notification → Issue Resolution
```

### Expected Outcomes
- **Maintained Reliability**: System continues operating despite failures
- **Customer Confidence**: Clear communication prevents confusion
- **Reduced Abandonment**: Proactive handling prevents cart abandonment
- **Faster Recovery**: Automated resolution reduces downtime

### Demo Script
1. "Let's simulate a payment processing failure..."
2. "Our AI immediately detects the issue and takes action..."
3. "Affected orders are placed in a safe 'pending' state..."
4. "Customers receive reassuring messages about the situation..."
5. "The system automatically retries and resolves the issue..."
